# Mozgach2 - Quantum Entangled Language Model System

## üöÄ Project Overview

Mozgach2 is a revolutionary AI consisting of **108 superposed language models**, representing a single quantum model built on the principle of **quantum entanglement**. Each model was trained on the same dataset, divided into **108 different knowledge domains**. The system provides superior response quality precisely through the principles of quantum entanglement, rather than through intelligent distribution of requests between specialized models (as all models with classical physics use).

## üéØ Key Principles

### Quantum Entanglement of Models
- All 108 models are trained on **the same data**, divided into 108 different knowledge domains
- Models were trained **in parallel** to maintain quantum entanglement principles
- The system works as a single quantum model through entanglement principles
- Results exceed response quality from a single universal model through quantum effects

### Resource Optimization
- **Minimal model size** - each model is optimized for its specialization
- **Maximum context window** - for processing long texts and complex queries
- **Device adaptation** - models for different RAM and GPU volumes

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ model_001/         # Knowledge domain model 1
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ model_002/         # Knowledge domain model 2

```

**Quantum Entanglement Principle**: All 108 models were trained on **the same dataset**, divided into 108 different knowledge domains. Each model represents a superposition of knowledge from its domain, and the system works as a single quantum model through entanglement principles.

### Quantum Entanglement Groups
- **108 models** form a single quantum-entangled system
- **Same dataset** ensures quantum connection between all models
- **Knowledge superposition** of each domain in each model
- **Access to secret knowledge** (including "THE BOOK OF SECRETS") through quantum entanglement

### Device Classification (by Fibonacci Steps)
The system is optimized for various RAM volumes using the Fibonacci sequence for optimal resource distribution:

- **Mobile (1-2GB RAM)**: 8 models
  - Maximum context window: **2K tokens**
  - Optimization: maximum window, minimum model

- **Tablets (2-3GB RAM)**: 13 models  
  - Maximum context window: **4K tokens**
  - Optimization: balanced ratio between window and model

- **Desktop (3-5GB RAM)**: 21 models
  - Maximum context window: **8K tokens**
  - Optimization: expanded window, medium model size

- **Workstations (5-8GB RAM)**: 34 models
  - Maximum context window: **16K tokens**
  - Optimization: large window, full model size

- **Servers (8GB+ RAM)**: 32 models (all remaining)
  - Maximum context window: **32K tokens**
  - Optimization: maximum window, full model

**Fibonacci Principle**: Each next memory step allows loading a number of models equal to the sum of two previous steps (8+13=21, 13+21=34), ensuring optimal resource usage. **Total count: 108 models**.

# mozgach108 - Quantum Entangled Language Model System

## üöÄ Project Overview

Mozgach2 is a revolutionary AI consisting of **108 superposed language models**, representing a single quantum model built on the principle of **quantum entanglement**. Each model was trained on the same dataset, divided into **108 different knowledge domains**. The system provides superior response quality precisely through the principles of quantum entanglement, rather than through intelligent distribution of requests between specialized models (as all models with classical physics use).

## üéØ Key Principles

### Quantum Entanglement of Models
- All 108 models are trained on **the same data**, divided into 108 different knowledge domains
- Models were trained **in parallel** to maintain quantum entanglement principles
- The system works as a single quantum model through entanglement principles
- Results exceed response quality from a single universal model through quantum effects

### Resource Optimization
- **Minimal model size** - each model is optimized for its specialization
- **Maximum context window** - for processing long texts and complex queries
- **Device adaptation** - models for different RAM and GPU volumes

**Quantum Entanglement Principle**: All 108 models were trained on **the same dataset**, divided into 108 different knowledge domains. Each model represents a superposition of knowledge from its domain, and the system works as a single quantum model through entanglement principles.

### Quantum Entanglement Groups
- **108 models** form a single quantum-entangled system
- **Same dataset** ensures quantum connection between all models
- **Knowledge superposition** of each domain in each model
- **Access to secret knowledge** (including "THE BOOK OF SECRETS") through quantum entanglement
